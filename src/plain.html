        <h1>Organize</h1>
          <p>Organization is key.  Start by stating the document's purpose and its bottom line.  Eliminate filler and unnecessary content.  Put the most important information at the beginning and include background information (when necessary) toward the end.</p>
        <h2>Organize for Users Needs</h2>
          <p>People read documents and visit websites to get answers. They want to know how to do something or what happens if they don't do something and they want to gain this knowledge quickly-. Organize your document to respond to these concerns. </p>
          <p>
          Think through the questions your audience is likely to ask and then organize your material in the order they'd ask them. For regulations and other complex documents, create a comprehensive table of contents. Your table of contents should be a reliable road map that users can follow to quickly find the information they need.
          </p>
        <h3>Chronological Organization</h3>
          <p>Regulations frequently address processes. Chronological organization is best for process information: you fill out an application to get a benefit; you submit the application; the agency reviews the application; the agency makes a decision on the application. Present the steps chronologically, in the order your user and your agency will follow them. The table of contents below is organized in a logical sequence for a grant program</p>
        <h3>What goes first?</h3>
          <p>Another useful organizing principle is to put general information first, with specialized information or exceptions to the general information later. That way the material that addresses most readers in most situations comes first. For some documents, this will work well along with a chronological organization. In others, it may be the primary organizing principle. </p>
        <h3>Use Three or Fewer Levels</h3>
          <p>Crafting documents with four, five, or even more levels makes it difficult for your audience to keep track of where they are in the structure of your document. You should address this problem in your initial structuring of the document. Dividing your document into more pieces at the top levels should allow you to limit subdivisions below the major level to two. The Office of the Federal Register recommends that regulations contain no more than three levels, noting that more than three levels make regulations hard to read and use. </p>
        <h3>Addresses Audiences Seperatly </h3>
          <p>If you have more than one audience for your document, address each one separately. No one wants to have to wade through material meant for someone else. For more discussion of this issue, see the section Address separate audiences separately.</p>

          <h2>Address One Person, not a Group</h2>
            <p>Remember that even though your document may affect a thousand or a million people, you are speaking to the one person who is reading it. When your writing reflects this, it's more economical and has a greater impact.</p>
            <p>
            Singular nouns and verbs prevent confusion about whether a requirement applies to individual users or to groups. In the following example, the user might think that each applicant must file applications at several offices.
            </p>
            <p>
            In addressing a single person, you can avoid awkwardness by using “you” to address the user directly, rather than using “he or she” or “his or her.”

          <h2>Use Lots of Useful Headings</h2>
            <p>The best-organized document will still be difficult for users to follow if they can't see how it's organized. An effective way to reveal your document's organization is to use lots of useful headings. Headings are also critical for effective web pages (see Writing for the web). You should use headings liberally on the web to help your user accomplish top tasks</p>
          <h3>Heading Types</h3>
            <p>
              There are three types of headings — 
            </p>
            <li>Question Heading - A Heading in the form of a question
	          Why do we use headings?
            </li>
            <li>Statement Heading - A heading that uses a noun and a verb
	           Heading Help Guide a Reader
            </li>
            <li>Topic Heading - A Heading that is a word or a short phrase
	            Headings
              </li>
          <h3>Question Headings</h3>
            <p>Question Headings are the most useful type of heading, but only if you know what questions your audience would ask. Most people come to government documents with questions.  If you know those questions, use them as headings.  They will help the audience find the information they are looking for quickly. Using the question-and-answer format helps your audience scan the document and find specific information.</p>
          <h3>Statement Headings</h3>
              <p>Statement Headings are the next best choice because they are still very specific. </p>
          <h3>Topic Headings</h3>
              <p>with them. But sometimes they're so vague that they just aren't helpful. Topic Headings such as “General,” “Application,” and “Scope” are so vague they may confuse the user. For example, “Application” might mean an application to your agency from someone reading your document. But it might as easily mean what the document applies to.</p>
          <h3>Reasons to Use Headings</h3> 
              <p>In the example above, the section headings in the right column are more informative than the short topic headings in the left column. Additionally, breaking the material into more sections allows us to capture the entire content of each section in its heading. A document with lots of informative headings is easy to follow because the headings break up the material into logical, understandable pieces. </p>
              <p>It's often useful to start writing your document by developing the headings, structuring them to your audience's concerns. This approach can also reveal major groupings of information that you might want to identify with centered headings.</p>
              <p>Headings should not be so long that they overwhelm the material in the section itself. Avoid headings with one-word answers. With rare exceptions, headings should be shorter than the content that follows them.</p>

            <h2>Use Short Sections</h2>
            <p>Short sections break up material so it appears easier to comprehend. Long, dense sections with no white space are visually unappealing, and give the impression your document is difficult to understand. Short sections appear easier to comprehend, and help you organize your document more effectively.</p>
            <p>Short sections also give you more opportunity to insert informative headings in your material. Remember that boldface section headings give your reader the best roadmap to your document. Long sections are impossible to summarize meaningfully in a heading. When you write short sections, each heading can give the reader information about the entire contents of the section. </p>
