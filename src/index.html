      <h1>Current Disability Statistics</h1>
      <p>Data pulled from CDC.gov</p>
      <h2> Disabilities in the United States </h2>

      <p
        >The 2021 American Community Survey by the Census Bureau reported 13% of
        all Americans have a non-institutionalized disability. Of the roughly
        38,903,887 adults with a disability in the United States, 19.7% of them
        live below the poverty line. This is almost double the number of adults
        in the United States who are below the poverty line. This is partially
        due to lower rates of employment for disabled people. In the United
        States, 25.9% of disabled people over the age of 16 are employed in the
        civilian sector, while 59.6% of all US citizens over 16 are employed in
        the same sector.
      </p>

      <p
        >Comparing the breakdown of disability between my current state of
        residence, Utah, and the United States, Utah has a disabled population
        of 342,378 or 10.3% of the total population, compared to the United
        States which has 42,485,034 disabled people or 13.0% of the total
        population. Table 1: Disability Type by Gender for Utah and the United
        States shows the disparities between genders and types of disabilities.
