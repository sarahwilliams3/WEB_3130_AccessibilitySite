        <h1>Site Design Process</h1>
        <p
          >Visually this site was built to be very simple. The color scheme was
          chosen to work together, but still be visully readable when overlaid.
          These colors show my love for darker colors mixed with a lighter color
          to accent. There is also enough white space to help everything be
          readable with out having too much white space. To chose the color
          scheme I used adobe color. Visually I want this site to be simple
          since it is more of an informative page. Despite its simplicity it
          shows the use of visual design being accessible. The visual design of
          this site will meet WCAG2.1 AA guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          The structural design is also very simple, but accessible. I used
          level one headings with level two headings following that and so
          forth. I want the structure to make sense for anyone using a screen
          reader, but also to be visually appealing and accessible to others as
          well. The nav is simple and easy to use while the rest of the page is
          easy to follow because heading levels are organized. The language used
          in this site is plain enough for all to understand. The Structural
          Design of this site will meet WCAG2.1 AA guidelines.
