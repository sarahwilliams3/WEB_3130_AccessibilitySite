        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>When I Hear "Accessibility"</h2>
        <p>
          I feel that accessibility is more important than ever. Without
          accessibility we are asking for people to leave our companyies, our
          blogs, or apps. When people come to our sites we want their
          experiences to be memorble in a way where they share and want others
          they know about the ease of using the page. This includes people with
          disabilities. More than 10% of people in the US have a vision or
          hearing disablily. If the internet is not accessible than we lose more
          10% of people who are customers, family, or friends. This is morally
          wrong, but it is also a disconnection of people which is huge in
          families, businesses, and many other relationships.
        </p>
        <h2>Automated Tools are NOT Enough</h2>
        <p>
          If we only test with automated tools we lose the opportunity to see
          how our sites and functions work in reality. Just because our images
          have alternative text doesn't mean that the text is actually helpful
          to someone who uses a screen reader. We may also have something like
          an alert that if it pulls someone from their task can make the site
          hard to use and not accessible even though automated tools say that
          the site is.
        </p>
        <h3> Accessibility standards I Use </h3>
        <p
          >I can use ARIA labels to help those with screen readers. I can also
          write appropriate alternative text for images. I can make text and
          background color have color contrast that is readible to all people
          including those with visual disabilities.
        </p>
        <h3> Why Inclusion During Design Matters </h3>
        <p
          >I would include all poeple in testing and design processes because
          this helps the site be easier to use, not only to those with a
          disability, but to all people. Having transcripts on videos help those
          with hearing disabilities, but it also helps people who can't use
          their sound because of their current location. So using all poepl for
          testing and design allows me to make better functioning webites for
          all people.

        <h2>My Accessibility Statement</h2>
        <p>This is an accessibility statement from Sarah Williams Foster. </p>
        <h3>Confromance Status</h3>
        <p>
          The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines requirements
          for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with
          disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level
          AA, and Level AAA. Sarah's Accessibility Site is fully conformant with
          WCAG 2.1 level AA. Fully conformant means that the content fully
          conforms to the accessibility standard without any exceptions.
        </p>
